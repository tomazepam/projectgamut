Landmass

Currently there is no name for the country in which Harrow is set, but the two counties are 
Greymere and Loneford. Each county contains numerous towns, all interconnected by paths and 
roads. The two counties are connected by a single main road between a town of each. 
(0.3 Beta: The country is now called "Gamut" (Gah-moot).)


Harrow's story takes place within Greymere County (particularly its north-western side).

Map of Greymere County. The large blue mass to the northwest is Lake Greymere. The areas in 
red represent everything outside this county. The isle to the southwest, Edge Island, is not 
part of the county, but is related to its story.

Greymere County h Inhabitants of either county are known to hold a copy of "The Map" (Beta 
Map seen above). This map portrays both counties, their limits and the near surrounding area. 
Whereas the map notes where the user is standing, it stops doing so upon reaching the map 
borders. Areas outside those drawn on the map are known by locals as The Limits.

Edge Island is a small landmass to the Southwest. Few people have managed to reach its shores,
and no one travelling there has ever come back. Home to what the locals call "The Abyss".
