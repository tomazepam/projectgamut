ELEMENT - MAP - POINT NORTH

Location 

Since this worlds northernmost point is very close to its civilisation, using compasses 
here works differently. Every surround area around Point North is geometrically south. 
Because of this directions often have DS (Desert South, heading toward Reo), HS (Hielo 
South, heading toward the Descon Isles) and GS (Green South, heading toward Lakeside). 
This only applies to directions. For example, Reo is Desert South, but Isla Norte is 
Hielo South. Other than compasses, the "North" of this world is considered the maps 
northern most point, rather than the true north itself. This would unintentionally work 
to the Descon favour during the Desconadia-Gamut War when Gamut soldiers found it impossible 
to map and use directions after having invaded Port Landing. It played a key role in the 
failure of the invasion.
