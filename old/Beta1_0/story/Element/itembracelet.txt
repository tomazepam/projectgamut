Object - String 

A homemade friendship bracelet. 

"A handmade bracelet my daughter gave me. I kept it tied to my wrist before 
I got here. It's the only thing left of the old world and she's the only thing 
I can remember. I'm going to keep her here. I don't want to lose the last piece of 
my old life in this place."
