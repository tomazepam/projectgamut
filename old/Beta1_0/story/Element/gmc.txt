ELEMENT - Gamut Mining Co. 
"Said to be the first settlers to arrive in Desconadia. Found the place was laden with 
gold and seemed to have stripped it clean. No reps around anymore." 

The Gamut Mining Co.was founded by the original explorers from the Kingdom of Gamut. 
Instead of returning home to announce their discovery, they instead kept the land a secret. 
They mined its gold to take back and covertly sell so they could acquire supplies to build 
their own country. 

They succeeded in spreading their influence and founded the country of Desconadia, after 
its arid desert. After some time the Kingdom of Gamut had purchased so much gold that it 
began to decrease in value as it rose in abundance. This lead to the Kingdom discovering 
the new country's existence and the Gamut-Desconadia War immediately ensued.
