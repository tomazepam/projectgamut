Country -  Desconadia 

"The large country mass in which Greymere County is situated. Seems to be known for its 
small size and variety of climates and biomes." The only known parts of Desconadia are 
two of an unknown amount of counties that make up the country as a whole and a set of 
islands to the east. None have been inhabited so far. These are: 

- Greymere County 
Mostly made up of an arid desert terrain, prized for its amount of mineable gold. 
Home to two known towns; Port Landing and Reo. 

- Longford County 
Mostly made of greenlands and swamps. Lakeside town rests on the coast of the Grieta bay. 
A large patch of land to the east of the tip of Greymere also belongs to Longford county 
and is home to the town of Point North. 

- Desconda Isles 
Home to the largely warring islands of Isla Norte and Isla Sur. There's a cluster of small 
islands to the north of them called Isla Perque√±as, but nothing about the massive glacier 
there..
