Location - Descon Desert 

"The large strip of land separating Port Landing and Reo. Arid, full of loose ground 
and long drops. You're always better sticking to the Descon Highway." 

Aside from an arid landscape and a desert floor that's prone to cave ins, the Descon 
Desert also has the famed Port Landing-Reo Highway.
