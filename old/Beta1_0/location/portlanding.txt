Location - Port Landing 

"A modern mini coastal city built atop an old mining town. There doesn't seem to be anyone 
left here.." 

The mining town was founded an undetermined time, with the city following shortly afterward. 
The mining town was founded after the area in which was discovered by explorers from the 
Kingdom of Gamut, a country and continent a vast distance away. Once the settlers began to 
mine they found large deposits of gold and coal. Slowly other companies from Gamut arrived 
and a city was built. A large mine on the outskirts then became the city's main export for 
gold and other precious materials. Because of the vast amount of money involved, the mine 
quickly became a restricted and secure area. The city thrived. After the success of the Port 
Landing Gold Mine, the owners of the mine opened the Gamut Mining Company, which set about 
opening new mines across the new country. The area in which these mines and their respective 
towns followed would later be called Greymere County. This brought the port city to life, 
until most of its inhabitants and workers move to the newer city of Reo, further up the coast.
After that, Port Landing became mostly focused on its thriving industry and mining. 

By the events of HARROW the micro city and its mine are largely deserted.
